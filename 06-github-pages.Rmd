# What is GitHub Pages?

1. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service.
2. Designed to host your personal, organisation or project pages directly from GitHub.
3. You get one site per GitHub account and organization, and unlimited project sites.

# User and Organisation Pages
## Create the repository

To create a user or organisation page, go to GitHub and create a new repository with the name `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub user name (or organisation name).

If the first part of the repository doesn't exactly match your GitHub username, it won't work, so make sure to get it right.

# User Pages
## Clone the repository

Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:

```
> git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```

# User Pages - Hello World
## Create your website

Enter the project folder and add an `index.html` file:

```
> cd username.github.io
> echo "Hello World" > index.html
```

# User Pages - Hello World
## Push it

Add, commit, and push your changes:

```
> git add .
> git commit -m "Initial commit"
> git push -u origin master
```

# User Pages
## ...and you're done!

Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io.

# { .fullpage }

<p class="subtitle subtitletop">Organisation Pages</p>

# Project Pages
* Project pages are different to user or organisation pages.
* They live in a separate `gh-pages` branch.
* That means that you can work with GitHub Pages in the same repository as the project that it's for, without affecting the project itself.

# Automatic Page Generator
* You don't need to have the skills to design your own web page.
* There are pre-designed layouts available.
* To apply one, go to the Settings for your repository.
* Then launch the Automatic Page Generator
